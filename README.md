.vim
========

My .vimrc configuration and plugins.
Influenced from [Carlos](https://github.com/carloslima), [Farzad](https://github.com/farzadghanei/), and [Athar](https://github.com/atharh).

This is forked from [farzadghanei/dotfiles](https://github.com/farzadghanei/dotfiles) which is originally based on [carloslima/dotfiles](https://github.com/carloslima/dotfiles).
I've customized it a bit, with some tricks that I learned from [Athar](https://github.com/atharh), and [Khairi](https://github.com/khairihafsham).

The used colorscheme is [Gotham](https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham).

## Installation
```
$ cd ~

$ git clone https://github.com/AmirBehzad/.vim.git

$ echo "source ~/.vim/vimrc" > ~/.vimrc

```
