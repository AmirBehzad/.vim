vimrc
========

My vimrc configuration

This is initially forked from [farzadghanei/dotfiles](https://github.com/farzadghanei/dotfiles) which is originally influenced from [carloslima/dotfiles](https://github.com/carloslima/dotfiles).
I've customized it just a bit, with some stuff that I learned from [Athar](https://github.com/atharh).

## Installation
```
$ cd ~

$ git clone https://github.com/AmirBehzad/.vim.git

$ echo "source ~/.vim/.vimrc" > ~/.vimrc

$ mkdir ~/.tmp
```
